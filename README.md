* I'm experienced with:
    * Python
    * JavaScript

* Iâ€™m planning to complement my studies with Project Management and Leadership programs because I strongly believe that that sort of abilities, help to fullfil certaing gaps that software developer often strugle with. Also, I believe my other IT experience can help me to grow into a Management position as the years go by.
